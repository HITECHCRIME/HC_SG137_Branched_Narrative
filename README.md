## Lyrics

```
livin' in an era (where)
our words are not the same
no sense in settlin' for one path
(that) branches out every step i take

left right left right
choices b'come undone
feels like a fucking game

spill ya guts like a riva MIA
in action now we trust  (thoughts)
so close to ending allmy mistakes

closing my eyes, feelin' the fiiii-re
in smoke is where rebooting takes place

ain't i tryin' to be a preacha
reach out to me again (bah)
sorry can't give (ya)
what's already taken (what you already taken)

esoteric creation
from the bygones
all I wanted from
this was a place
I'd call home
but it's gone
but it's gone
drifting lone i can't
preach if noone's (really) actually here
inside out  pulled through a mirror
reflecting deeds i've done
if i want to get up
i can't stay the same

```
