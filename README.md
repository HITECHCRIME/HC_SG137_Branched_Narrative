## Lyrics

```
livin' in an era (where)
our words are not the same
no sense in settlin' for one path
(that) branches out every step i take

left right left right
choices b'come undone
feels like a fucking game

spill ya guts like a riva MIA
in action now we trust  (thoughts)
so close to ending allmy mistakes

closing my eyes, feelin' the fiiii-re
in smoke is where rebooting takes place


```
